# Programming Assignment 4: Sets, Multiway Tries (MWTs), and Ternary Search Trees (TSTs)
In this Programming Assignment, you will be assessing your understanding of Sets, Multiway Tries (MWTs), and Ternary Search Trees (TSTs).

## Part 0: Setup
This PA requires some extra tools for the code coverage part.
Check the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) document for details.

### Task: Create a CMakeLists.txt
Create a `CMakeLists.txt` configured to compile `SetTest.cpp`. The target executable should have the name `SetTest`.
Register it as a test with CTest under the name `test_SetTest`.

## Part 1: Implementing the Set ADT (40 points)
The [Set Abstract Data Type (ADT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) is an ADT that can store unique elements. Generally, the Set ADT is defined by the following operations:
* ``size``: Return the number of elements stored in the set
* ``insert(x)``: Insert element ``x`` into this set (don't allow duplicates)
* ``remove(x)``: Remove element ``x`` from this set (if it exists)
* ``find(x)``: Determine whether or not ``x`` exists in this set

We can implement the Set ADT using various data structures we have already learned about, and we can even simply wrap around existing C++ classes:
* We can use an [Array List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array), which is implemented in the C++ [``vector``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) class
* We can use a [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), which is implemented in the C++ [``list``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/) class
* We can use a [Red-Black Tree (RBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), which is implemented in the C++ [``set``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) class
* We can use a [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), which is implemented in the C++ [``unordered_set``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/) class
* We can use a [Multiway Trie (MWT)](https://stepik.org/lesson/30819/step/1), which is not natively implemented in C++
* We can use a [Ternary Search Tree (TST)](https://stepik.org/lesson/30820/step/1), which is not natively implemented in C++

### Task 1a: Edit [``ArrayListSet.cpp``](ArrayListSet.cpp) (10 points)
In this repository, there is a file called [``ArrayListSet.cpp``](ArrayListSet.cpp) that contains initial steps towards implementing the Set ADT using an Array List via the C++ [``vector``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) class. Function headers (with usage details) are included in [``Set.h``](Set.h). Your task is to fill in the missing code.

### Task 1b: Edit [``LinkedListSet.cpp``](LinkedListSet.cpp) (10 points)
In this repository, there is a file called [``LinkedListSet.cpp``](LinkedListSet.cpp) that contains initial steps towards implementing the Set ADT using a Linked List via the C++ [``list``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/) class. Function headers (with usage details) are included in [``Set.h``](Set.h). Your task is to fill in the missing code.

### Task 1c: Edit [``RedBlackTreeSet.cpp``](RedBlackTreeSet.cpp) (10 points)
In this repository, there is a file called [``RedBlackTreeSet.cpp``](RedBlackTreeSet.cpp) that contains initial steps towards implementing the Set ADT using a Red-Black Tree via the C++ [``set``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) class. Function headers (with usage details) are included in [``Set.h``](Set.h). Your task is to fill in the missing code.

### Task 1d: Edit [``HashTableSet.cpp``](HashTableSet.cpp) (10 points)
In this repository, there is a file called [``HashTableSet.cpp``](HashTableSet.cpp) that contains initial steps towards implementing the Set ADT using a Hash Table via the C++ [``unordered_set``](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/) class. Function headers (with usage details) are included in [``Set.h``](Set.h). Your task is to fill in the missing code.

## Part 2: Implementing a Multiway Trie (MWT) (30 points)
Imagine we want to insert *n* elements of length *k* into our set. Array Lists, Linked Lists, and Red-Black Trees all scale as a function of *n* in the average and worst cases, and although Hash Tables are O(*k*) in the average case, they scale as a function of *n* in the worst case, and they have no inherent order. Instead, if we implement the Set ADT using a Multiway Trie, our find, insert, and remove operations will all be O(*k*) in the worst case, meaning our data structure's runtime will not worsen as *n* increases, and we can iterate over our elements in sorted order.

### Task: Edit [``MultiwayTrieSet.cpp``](MultiwayTrieSet.cpp) (30 points)
In this repository, there is a file called [``MultiwayTrieSet.cpp``](MultiwayTrieSet.cpp) that contains initial steps towards implementing the Set ADT using a Multiway Trie. Function headers (with usage details) are included in [``Set.h``](Set.h). Your task is to fill in the missing code.

## Parts 1-2: Testing (5 points)
We have provided a tester program, [``SetTest``](SetTest.cpp), that will help you test your code. You can compile it as follows:

```bash
g++ -Wall -pedantic -g -O0 -std=c++11 -o SetTest SetTest.cpp ArrayListSet.cpp HashTableSet.cpp LinkedListSet.cpp MultiwayTrieSet.cpp RedBlackTreeSet.cpp
```

Or using the CMake configuration that you created in Part 0.

If nothing is printed by ``SetTest``, then your functions in Parts 1 and 2 are correct. Otherwise, ``SetTest`` will print out which classes are incorrect, such as the following:

```
$ ./SetTest
ArrayListSet failed
HashTableSet failed
LinkedListSet failed
MultiwayTrieSet failed
RedBlackTreeSet failed
```

### Task: Generate a Code Coverage Report (5 points)

If code is not executed by your test cases then that code is essentially untested.
Untested code may hide bugs, so it would be interesting to know which lines of code did not get executed by running SetTest.

Luckily there are tools that can provide us with this information. These tools are called Code Coverage Tools and GCC actually comes with such a tool called `gcov`.

Then there also exist tools that can transform the Code Coverage information into a human readable report. For `gcov` data you can use the tool `lcov` to generate a report.

We already created a script for you which will generate a code coverage report using `gcov` and `lcov`. You can find it under the `build_scripts` directory in your project.

This script is intended to be used with CMake so please don't try to run it directly. To configure CMake to run the script, append the following to the bottom of your CMakeLists.txt file:

```bash
add_custom_target(cov COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/build_scripts/generate_coverage_report -r "make" "make test")

# Make sure build_scripts are always runnable
add_custom_target(chmod COMMAND chmod +x ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/build_scripts/*)
add_dependencies(cov chmod)
```

Additionally, you'll want to update `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` to enable coverage tracking in your C++ compiler. Include the following line before your first build target in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```bash
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} --coverage -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -std=c++11")
```

Now you can generate the coverage report by running `make -C build cov`.

> ### ðŸ›  Know Your Tools - CMake
> CMake comes with a few standard build rules: `add_executable` and `add_library`.
> If you want to do something more special you can use `add_custom_target` to define your own build rule. By copy pasting the CMake config above, you just added two custom targets: `cov` and `chmod` to your CMake config.
> This means that after running `make` you should be able to run `make cov` as well as `make chmod`.
> The target `chmod` makes sure the the scripts under `build_scripts/` have run permissions. By using `add_dependencies` we declared `chmod` to be a dependency of the `cov` target. This makes sure that `chmod` is always run before `cov`, which makes sure you'll never get a permissions error when you run `make cov`.


Now run `make` in your build directory. After that you should be able to run `make cov` and it will generate the code coverage report for you.

To open the code coverage report you have to locate your project on your local computer using your file browser. Then navigate to `build/code_coverage/report` and open `index.html` with your browser.
If you work on ieng6 you'll have to download the report using `scp` or `rsync`. Alternatively you can make an exception in the `.gitignore` file for the `build/code_coverage/report` directory. You can make [gitignore exceptions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2415873/exceptions-in-gitignore) by prepending a `!`.


> ### ðŸ›  Know Your Tools - LCOV
> Code Coverage is sometimes referred to as "Test Coverage". These terms mean the same thing: which parts of the codebase were covered by the test cases.
>
> For `gcov` to be able to record code coverage metrics, your code needs to be compiled with code coverage tracking enabled.
>
> As explained above,[`lcov`](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) can generate a report from code coverage data generated by `gcov`. This makes `lcov` what is called a `front-end` for `gcov`.
> You can find an example of an lcov report [here](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/output/index.html)
>
> You can see the total line coverage percentage of the current project/directory/file in the top right corner of the page in the lcov report.
> To get more finegrained data, you can click on the directory and file links in the report. Once you arrive at a source file you'll be able to see the actual lines of code that have been covered by the tests.
>
> A covered line appears in blue and an uncovered line appears in orange.
>
> If a test case fails its code coverage is no longer counted. So you need to have at least one passing test case before you can generate a report, because `lcov` will report an error if it cannot find any coverage data.
>
> Note that the report does not only contain information about lines, but also about branches and functions.
> Branches are pieces of code that get executed or not based on a condition. Examples of this are if/else statements.
>
> A C++ compiler will sometimes inject extra branches or functions for things such as exception handling. These injected branches and functions can be hard/impossible to cover with test cases. So the Branches- and Functions Coverage metrics in the report have limited use in C++, but they may still provide interesting insights at times.
> To minimize the impact of these changes made by the compiler, you'll want to compile with the lowest possible optimization level for an accurate code coverage report.

## Parts 1-2: Checking for Memory Leaks (5 points)
To receive these 10 points, your implementations for both Part 1 and Part 2 must not have any memory leaks. You can use ``valgrind`` to check for memory leaks. For example, you can run it as follows:

```bash
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./SetTest
```

If it gives you a report like the following, you do not have memory leaks and are good to go (the important part is ``All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible``):

```

==1482== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.

==1482==
==1482== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==1482== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

If you *do* have memory leaks, the report will look something like the following:
```
==1516== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==1516== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.

```

## Part 3: Ternary Search Trees (TSTs) (8 points)
Unfortunately, when a MWT is sparse, it can waste a ***lot*** of space. The Ternary Search Tree (TST) is essentially the combination of a MWT and a BST, and it can be useful for contexts in which we would want to use a MWT (e.g. spell-checking and autocompletion) but don't have enough memory.

### Task 3a: Create ``3a.txt`` (2 points)
Imagine we have the following TST:

Create a file called ``3a.txt`` (case-sensitive) in the root directory of this repository (i.e., in the same folder as [``README.md``](README.md)) containing the list of strings (1 per line) that are contained in this TST (the order of the lines doesn't matter). For example, if it contained the strings ``niema`` and ``moshiri``, your file would contain the following:

```
niema
moshiri
```

The following would also be equally correct:

```
moshiri
niema
```

### Task 3b: Create ``3b.txt`` (2 points)

Create a file called ``3c.txt`` (case-sensitive) in the root directory of this repository (i.e., in the same folder as [``README.md``](README.md)) containing the list of strings (1 per line) that are contained in this TST (the order of the lines doesn't matter). For example, if it contained the strings ``niema`` and ``moshiri``, your file would contain the following:

```
niema
moshiri
```

The following would also be equally correct:

```
moshiri
niema
```

## Academic Integrity
This Programming Assignment (PA) must be completed 100% independently! You may only discuss the PA with the Tutors, TAs, and Instructors. You are free to use resources from the internet, but you are not allowed to blatantly copy-and-paste code. If you ever find yourself highlighting a code snippet, copying, and pasting into your PA, you are likely violating the Academic Integrity Policy. If you have any concerns or doubts regarding what you are about to do, *please* be sure to post on Piazza first to ask us if it is okay.
